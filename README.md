My name is Dreylon, I am interested in puzzles and computers and I want to have a job I can enjoy, so I want to develop my programming skills more, as well as my problem-solving skills and my analytical thinking skills. 
Beyond that, I am determined to continue learning and applying the skills i have developed to accomplish my tasks without issues.
